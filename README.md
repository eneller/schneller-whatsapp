# Whatsup-Poll
CLI Whatsapp Polls using go:
- [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow), which now also has python bindings with [neonize](https://github.com/krypton-byte/neonize).
- [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) for the command line

Simply pass the content of the `id` field of your group as CLI argument.
Can be easily scheduled using `crontab` because of its non-interactive operation.
